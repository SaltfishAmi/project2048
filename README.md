# Project 2048

A remake of the popular "2048" mobile game to the good old command line interface.

Windows and DOS versions available.

# Build

Please use Borland(R) C++Builder 6.0 to build this.

# Features

* Self-explanatory "2048" game
* Good old command line interface
* Selectable grid sizes from 3x3 to 8x8
* Save datas in RAM and file

# Notice

* The delay of "Loading" "Saving" is just time delay. It doesn't do anything that requires such a long time but, well, modern computers are just TOO fast for such a game so we need a bit compensate right?
* There is a critical bug in the gameplay. If you have [8 2 2 2] and you press left, would it become [8 4 2 -] or [8 2 4 -]? I didn't know (in fact I even don't know after the years), so it seems that it will become [8 4 - 2] in this program, which is obviously wrong. Well, who cares, nobody plays it anyway. Maybe I'll fix it up if I remember.
